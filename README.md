## Libraries Used
I used two libraries, the first one is pandas to be able to import dataframe files.
Second one is seaborn, this libtrary helped me in drawing heat map.

## Motivation For The Project
Many tourists who are visiting Washigton for the first time are in need to know simple information about prices of thier stay and what type of property they are going to choose

So i decided to help them through outcomes of this code

## Files List And Description

- Blog file: it is the final outcome and conclusions any tourist can read, no need to have any background technical knowledge 
- Code File: it is the code i developed to write down my blog, you need to have python backgroud before exploring it

## Results Summary

I found some highlights as 
- Boats are the top expensive property type while dorms are the cheapest.
- Prices are very correlated to number of bedrooms in the location
- Magnolia is the most expensive neighborhood in the city


## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my manager who gave me the ability to write down this blog and code during my working hours in order to help me learning new things and boarden my knowledge.
