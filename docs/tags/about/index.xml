      <description>Welcome to the “Practical Statistics” group for statistical methods that people expect us to know but that we have no idea about.
Members of this group meet once every two weeks for the purpose of learning common statistical methods that we should, but don’t, know how to use in practice (but that people in other fields think we do).
Such topics include
 ANOVA
 Mixed effects models
 Power calculations</description>
