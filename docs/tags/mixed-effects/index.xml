      <description>Last time Practical Statistics met to try to wrap our heads around fixed, mixed, and random effects. Chelsea Zhang gave a great chalk-talk (white board marker-talk just doesn’t have the same ring to it), and I will give a brief summary of the content before going through a real-life example.
Who Uses Fixed, Mixed, and Random Effects? Two main groups use these terms but are referring to different models. The economists and broadly speaking, “bio folks” are the two main crowds who use these types of models.</description>
